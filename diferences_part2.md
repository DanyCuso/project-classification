##Diferences among if-else vs switch 

**IF-ELSE**

```sh 
this command takes a statement and evaluates it if it is true or false, if it is true, it executes the contiguous code and if it is false, it skips the contiguous code and goes to the second code option
```

**SWITCH**

```sh
This command takes a statement and evaluates its value predisposed by the conditions of the switch, from this it chooses one of multiple branches of code to proceed with the execution of the same
```

##Do-while vs while vs for 

**DO-WHILË**

```sh
this command takes a statement and subjects it to a condition, if it is true the code follows its linear course executing the lines of code that follow in the program, if the condition turns out to be false,
the code restarts from the statement, until the condition is true
```

**WHILE**

```sh
this command takes a statement and subjects it to a condition, if it is true the code follows its linear course, if the condition turns out to be false, the code restarts from the statement, until the condition is true
```
**FOR**

```sh
this command collects data and compiles it into a database, which can handle all the data at the same time, facilitating its reelection, work and classification
```
